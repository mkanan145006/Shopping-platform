# Shopping-platform
this project is a shopping system that has 2 types of users, a buyer and a seller, a seller is allowed to add items to his shop to sell, a buyer is allowed to navigate between sellers to decided what to buy, its very basic and has no gui, was only for learning C#.NET thought someone might find this useful
